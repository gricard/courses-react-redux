# courses-react-redux

> A react/redux project

This is a react/redux application I implemented while participating in [Corey House](https://github.com/coryhouse)'s excellent [React/Redux course on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6). 
This includes some of the completed additional assignments from the end of the course.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

    OR

yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run all tests
npm test
```

Note: This is not a real, full application. It was just an educational exercise. I'm making it public only because it could be helpful to others.
