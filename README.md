# courses-react-redux

> A react/redux project

This is a react/redux application I made while participating in Corey House's React/Redux course on Pluralsight 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

    OR

yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
